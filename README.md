# Airbnb Clone Team Project

## Background Context

Welcome to the Airbnb Clone project! This project is the first step towards building a full web application that emulates the functionality of Airbnb. Before you begin, it's essential to understand the Airbnb concept. Please read the [Airbnb Concept Page](https://www.airbnb.com/about/about-us).

### Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create a command interpreter that manages Airbnb objects. This command interpreter will serve as the foundation for building the complete Airbnb clone. The work you do in this initial step will be crucial because it forms the basis for all subsequent projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.

In this project, you will:

1. Implement a parent class called `BaseModel` responsible for initializing, serializing, and deserializing future object instances.
2. Create a simple serialization/deserialization flow: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON String <-> File.
3. Define classes for various Airbnb objects such as User, State, City, Place, etc., all of which will inherit from `BaseModel`.
4. Develop the initial abstracted storage engine for the project, known as File storage.
5. Write unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.

## What's a Command Interpreter?

Think of the Command Interpreter as a user-friendly interface to interact with your Airbnb objects. It's similar to a shell, but it's tailored to the specific needs of your project. With the Command Interpreter, you can perform various operations on Airbnb objects, including:

- Creating new objects (e.g., User or Place).
- Retrieving objects from files, databases, or other sources.
- Performing operations on objects, such as counting and computing statistics.
- Updating attributes of an object.
- Deleting objects when they are no longer needed.

This Command Interpreter will serve as a powerful tool to manage and manipulate Airbnb data within your application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Airbnb Clone project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd AirBnB_clone
   ```

3. Begin working on your command interpreter and Airbnb object classes.

## Usage:

To use the command interpreter and manage your Airbnb objects, follow these steps:

1. Run the command interpreter:

   ```
   ./console.py
   ```

2. You will be presented with a prompt where you can enter commands to create, retrieve, update, and delete Airbnb objects.

3. Use the command syntax and structure defined in your project's documentation to interact with the command interpreter effectively.

## Contributing:

If you would like to contribute to the Airbnb Clone project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the project on GitHub.

2. Create a new branch for your contributions:

   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Make your changes and ensure that they adhere to the project's coding standards and conventions.

4. Write tests to validate your changes.

5. Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.

6. Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

7. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main project repository.
